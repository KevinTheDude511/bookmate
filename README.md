## What is BookMate?
We believe that everyone has the right to access the vast knowledge of humanity stored in books. Therefore, BookMate was born to make our belief come true. BookMate is a platform which allows book lovers to meet online, engage in conversations, discover their new favorite genres and on top of that, exchange books. 

## Why we choose this?
Every year, a massive amount of books are discarded. In the USA, approximately 960,000 tons of books were discarded in 2009 alone. However, only a third was recovered, which means that roughly 640,000 tons of books were disposed of into the landfill. In contrast to this fact, many people, especially students from low-income families, are unable to afford books. To cope with unnecessary wastage, some students and book lovers look for a way to sell their used books, to exchange with a like-minded fellow, or to give them away to people in need. Even so, they meet some unforeseeable difficulties, such as expensive shipping fees or lack of suitable receivers in their area. To many, book giving can be a laborious and costly process.

BookMate is created since we are aware of how disastrous the aforementioned problems can be in the near future. By acting as an intermediary, we can connect people who are willing to give away their books and people who are in need of those.

## Website
Currently, our project is under development, so most of its features are not available yet. You can take a look at the detail of the books you want, upload (we mean offer) the books you have; however, you cannot request for the books you want. We are working on it, and we hope that we can release that feature in the near future, so stay tuned!
